# Code-Refactor

## Start

Learning how to refact code is an skill the you will need to develop as a junior developer.  
 Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality.



##  My Goals
```
    1. To Understand the importance of refactoring.
    2. Try to understand what to look for when refactoring HTML Code/CSS Code.
   
```
   
## Conclusion

1. Organizing the code, made it cleaner to see where the header/footer/main more clear.
2. Catching mistakes that i would not notice at first but with time seen.

The following benefits were for CSS:

1. There was code that i could see that looked cluttered so it gave me a better understanding to use classes and Ids. 
2.  By using Classes and IDs it help me clean up the ampunt of lines.
